  Arrays can't use the `...` spread currently. Please use `concat` or other Array helpers.

  Array's `...` spread is not supported in pattern matches.
Explanation: such spread would create a subarray; out of performance concern, our pattern matching currently guarantees to never create new intermediate data.
Solution: if it's to validate the first few elements, use a `when` clause + Array size check + `get` checks on the current pattern. If it's to obtain a subarray, use `Array.sub` or `Belt.Array.slice`.

  4 │ let record = {...x, ...y}
  5 │ let {...x, ...y} = myRecord
  6 │ 

  Records can only have one `...` spread, at the beginning.
Explanation: since records have a known, fixed shape, a spread like `{a, ...b}` wouldn't make sense, as `b` would override every field of `a` anyway.

  7 │ let list{...x, ...y} = myList

  Record's `...` spread is not supported in pattern matches.
Explanation: you can't collect a subset of a record's field into its own record, since a record needs an explicit declaration and that subset wouldn't have one.
Solution: you need to pull out each field you want explicitly.

  List pattern matches only supports one `...` spread, at the end.
Explanation: a list spread at the tail is efficient, but a spread in the middle would create new lists; out of performance concern, our pattern matching currently guarantees to never create new intermediate data.
